# DS4002 Prototyping - Project 2, Group 9:  Predicting Natural Gas Price Fluctuations Amid Extreme Events
This repository is to store our data, scripts, and output for our project. All contributions are done by Vaibhav Jha, Nick Kellogg, and Megan Vander Wiele. 

## Repository Contents
- #### Software and Platform (MAC OSX): For this project, the data was given out upon request, meaning there was no scraping necessary. In terms of data analysis, we used a Python Notebook and multiple packages such as numpy, pandas, and matplot. All of the data is stored in three separate xlsx files.

#### Reproducton Results:
- To reproduce our results, first ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary packages, including numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. Then, download the repository and place the provided data files in the DATA/ folder. Finally, open and run AnalysisScript.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment to execute the analysis and generate the data visualization.
